Landing Page, Odin Project Foundations Course

HTML and CSS practice, as per the end of the CSS and HTML Foundations section of the Odin Project. I was given just a picture of a landing page design and re-created it to the best of my ability. This was an interesting and challenging project, using a lot of design and style basics and plenty of Flexbox!
